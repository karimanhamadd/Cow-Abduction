# UFO grabbing a pig
[4 Marks] At least one hierarchical object of at least three levels in the hierarchy  (e.g. human arm body -> shoulder -> elbow ...) where joint motion clearly shows the interaction between levels. A good example of this is the legs in A1, note that legs in A2 will not count (you can not simply use the legs to fulfill this requirement).
#### Yes I have added this , in scene 2 the alien has the arm the lowerarm the the hand an dtwo fings , there is the motion of the lower arm and the joint"elbow" in between that shows this hierchical structure.You can also see the pig with the hierchical structure , but there is movement , he is more static

[4 Marks] 360-degree camera fly around using lookAt() and setMV() to move the camera in a circle while focusing on a point that the camera is circling. This can be a single fly around or can be a part of a composed scene or can be a loop.
#### yes i have added this at the begining of my scene for one round or turn

[4 Marks] Connection to real-time. You should make sure that your scene runs in real-time on fast enough machines. Real-time means that one simulated second corresponds roughly to one real second.
#### yes i was using realtime

[6 Marks] Make use of at least two textures either procedural or mapped. You must map them to a(n) object(s) in a meaningful way. Using the textures from the Lab modified assignment base code does not count toward the two. Simply placing a texture on a default object using the default object coordinates does not count. Using textures as in the lab code with no meaningful or non-trivial development does not count.
[5 Marks] Convert the ADS shader in the assignment base code from a vertex shader to a fragment shader. You need to compute the lighting equation per fragment.

### yes using the basecode//lab i have modfied it to im using a grafmnet shader instead. In vec4 ads(..) in the html file of course
[2 Marks] Convert the Phong to Blinn-Phong in the new fragment shader created in step 3.

### yes done in html file
[5 Marks] At least one shader effect designed from scratch to perform a clearly visible novel effect (novel w.r.t basecode and labs). This can be directly incorporated in the given shader basecode or added to the HTML file, loaded, and compiled as an additional shader program make use of. Each line of your shader code must be commented clearly explaining exactly what the following line does and why. You must clearly identify the purpose and effect the shader produces in the submitted README. Note that some really cool effects require very little code. Note that your effect can use a texture and thus may count as part of your novel texture count above (you need to document this in your readme)! Think about how lighting works, how surfaces work, and how your favourite, games, movies, and comics look.
Past examples: Create a spotlight rather than a directional light, cel-shading, swirl effect, water caustics, blur, glow, edge highlighting, x-ray, CRT (retro gaming TV), etc.
Please be careful here, it is very tempting to pull effects from Shadertoy, YouTube gurus, or some other shader resource. You need to complete this item yourself! You are better off working out and coding a simple one-line effect that is well explained than copying someone else's effect (one can get you full marks, and the other can lead to an academic integrity case).

### unfortunately , not as complex (if it is) as making a spoghtlight or the blurry effect in the example. But i find teh tinting in green suit my scene. I woudve love making a light under the UFO but couldnt. SO yes, i added a tint , which i show on the stars and cow and UFO in scene 1 at the end.
## Although I did NOT use any of the code in here i got inspires by the pulsing triangle color wheel example here where i got the idea to make a tint : https://shader-tutorial.dev/basics/fragment-shader/

[5 Marks] Complexity: scene setup and design, movement of animated elements, and programming.
### animated the pig to "lift" up , animated the aliens hand, animated the UFO . Animated the "mooon" , animated the stars , animated the alien to go up and down. 
[5 Marks] Creativity: storytelling, scene design, object appearance and other artistic elements.
### pig in first scene to then show the alien world in scene 2 and the ufo traveling from that scene back to scne 1 to abduct the pig
[5 Marks] Quality:  Attention to detail, modelling quality, rendering quality, motion control.
### I believe i tried my best especially with the abudction part , played with shrinking , variables , a lot of them, and lifting up and so on.
[2 Marks] Programming style.
### i remmeber the prof talking about this being for the clean look , function made and so on. Unlike a1 i have made fucntion and simply call them in the render fucntion. This actually helped alot becaus eof the amount of things in the scenes
[-2 Marks if not] Make and submit a movie of your complete scene. The movie should be the resolution of your canvas, and in a standard file format/codec such as mp4. Include a cover image (png or jpg) from your movie. You may use any screen capture program that is available (e.g. ShareX). Some additional info below.
### I was not sure what image was needed , i have attached the first thing you owuld see when u play. it wasnt really specied so i ust picked the first thing ever 
[-4 Marks if not] Provide a readme.txt that describes what you have done, what you have omitted, and any other information that will help the grader evaluate your work, including what is stated below.
### yes
